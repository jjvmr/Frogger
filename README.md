# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This simple yet interesting game allows the player to move in any direction to reach the goal, the other side while trying to avoid enemies. If the player is touched by the enemy, the game will restart. However, if the player reaches the goal, the player will advance to the next level and the enemies will increase in speed.
